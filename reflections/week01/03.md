## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
In my opinion my favorite design tip is probably the most basic out of the tips, but its the utilization of weighted text to create a visual hierarchy on our broswer. I say this only because, to my eyes well weighted text looks really good on the eyes and allows a good meshing of information

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
1)I cant find the link, but today in class mark used a website that allows plugins for choosing a design template and revamping everything in quick succesion
2)https://dribbble.com/shots
3) https://heroicons.com
4)https://icons.getbootstrap.com

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
Case example. Lets recall to middle school when we were doing research project, and that random site you stumble upon for facts about chistopher columbus looks like a microsoft crash window. The color scheme was so dull your practically became color blind for a week, and your cant understand why they type and entire paragraph in hypertext. 
In other words, when a site is pleasing to the human eye/mind, it entices users to use your site over other competitors within the market

My one takeaway today, was how mindblowing bootstrap was since it "simplifies" the process of creating class ids since it practically does all the muscle work for you. However, it just a matter of me getting use to all the moving parts within the code.
