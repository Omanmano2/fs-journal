## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
  A psuedo-class is a sort of descriptor word that is used in a selector to manipulate specific aspect(s) of a class element. In other words, psuedo classes are preset commands within Unix that changes an element whereas a psuedo element is when you specify an elements properties inside a selector in the style.css file. I believe the most common pseudo classes we'll continue to use are the :active :enabled :read-only :write-only 

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
Specificity is a the hard to say word. Nah, specificity in computing is the level of imortance given to certain rules that try to affect the same element but with different values. This allows, for all but one rule to rule them all. Specificity will probaly be used to manipulate how multiple functions will effect an element ie a video game score that records a players score while events either raise or lower a score

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
I believe if you over do the !importance function, the computer will have a trouble understanding how to determine which property to give an element if you have multiple different psueclasses working on a single element.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
The major take away in todays assignment was to just get comfortable around working with the front end code and getting to understand how to properly ask coding questions to get the most level of understanding out of my work. After getting a couple good hours in of coding today due to running into all the problems other coders ran into. At the end of it all, I believe I have a much greater understanding on psuedo-elements than I did this morning.
