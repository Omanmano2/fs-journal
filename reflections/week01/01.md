## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?
The purpose of utilizing Git is in order to stay organized over extended periods of times while coding alone, or with others. To achieve this level of organization, git saves data on your local storage and keeps record of all instances of change.


2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
The benefits of having multiple branches in Git, is primarily intended to help all actors within the project. It does this by creating screenshots of changes when a user modifies code on their local, and then notifies the associated team. 


3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub
So, the main difference between git and github, is where the data is stored. Git accesses the local storage of the machine, whereas GitHub utilizes cloud storage in order for it to be accessible by others disconnected to local storage.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

While setting up my work environment today, my take away from today was getting an understanding on how the collaboration process is going to probably work in the future by utilizing the features of git and github. As I was doing the coding intro before class, I was quite confused as why we had to download Git and Github due to the fact that we never had to open up git after launching its setup file, but after diving into the topic a little bit more with the instructors today my questions were cleared up. Then once SCRUM was introduced to me, I slowly started coming to the realization that understanding all the nuances of GitHub is very important not only for this class but suceeding in the work force. Oh, I also learned that you aren't entitled to workers compensation if you are the CEO. |//////////////|   0---<
