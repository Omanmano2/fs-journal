## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
The purpose of wire framing is primarily to function as a graphic organizer to describe the layout for a website's structure. Or more exact terms "Define and Plan The Information Hierarchy", and this in turn allows a large group of individuals to collaborate with one another efficiently. ie The Devs, StakeHolders, Users. Most importantly wireframs are the easiest, least time consuming (cost efficient) way to create a 'website'.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
The threee levels of detail are low fidelity, mid fidelity, high fidelity wireframes
1)low fidelity wire-frames are basic visuals, usually drawn onto paper, to get the ball rollling on a project
2)mid fidelity wire-frames take into account the finished decided project of the low fidelity model. Except it upgrades a more concise model of the website using a 3rd party application such as sketch, or if you are a mad lad msPaint. 
3) 3rd wire-frame is Figma and thats it. Nothing more, nothing less. Jk, a high fidelity model describes specifics geometric spacing and sizing of all elements (images, text, etc)

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
In my experience with life, I know one thing. When I'm grinding my freshly maxed lvl Orc Warrior and realize that doing the main quests and dailes are more boring than watching paint dry try and dry in Virginia, I usually say screw it and queue up some PvP battlegrounds to just get completely wrecked. I persist on doing this for days, all to realize I should probably go do my main quests and dungeon grind to get up to date. So, jumping into a fray without being prepared usually leads to problematic events, a waste of time, and very little succes. So I guess what im trying to say is that I believe wire frame is worth the time and effort it takes becuase it will definetly save time down the long run.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today was actually a really fun lab, because not only did it further push myself to overcome coding problems but it created another roadblock. I didn't quite know how to be an effective coding partner, but that was part of the fun. For example, I was pretty self concious about coming off as someone thats too controlly, since I was suggesting that we should format the code in a more "proper" fashion (keeping parents aligned). On top of that, I feel like im getting a bit more comfortable with the whole concept of flex boxxes and bootstrap. I say this only because I finally feel like I understand how to utilize rows and columns, but most importantly how class=id's affect the parent and its children.
