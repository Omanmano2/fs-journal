## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?
User experience or UX for short, is the ease of access and control of an app which is accomplish through strategically formatting the view and incorporating AAA features to give a clear first base understanding on how to navigate the app and use it without a headache. For example, a stock chart analysis application usually has a poor UX for beginners/novices since it caters to people who have a better understanding of economics and data analysis of stock charts. When designing around UX, its important to understand the target demographic. Tik tok for example, uses a simplistic ux for maximum dopamine to further keep their brain chemical addicts swiping through terabytes of content a day.

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?
  The benefit is that your customer base will have a better experience which means more money coming in. If the ux fits a large customer demographic, then it's likely that again you'll gain more users. Coinbase is a good example of this because the UX of coinbase makes it where a freakin block of lead could buy and trade shitcoins if it had to. 

3. Why is the User Experience important?
  User experience is important because similar to the code itself having profressional standards, the UI follows the same suit. I think of the UX similar to a cockpit of a jet or race car. All the buttons arent randomly just put placed (in most cases) in a random spot, but rather its engineered in a way to allow the operator to have the easiest access to important features. Example, a formula one wheel is designed so the dials for traction control, brake bias, and engine mapping are a thumb and wrist movement away from being changed to the drivers preference. Similar to UI, if theres a input group to create a list or something idk, it shouldnt be hiding in a random spot. It should sit like at the top of the element or at the bottom. Think of slack, the text input field is fixed at the bottom of the upward scrolling posts, and not in some random button modal access gateway.
