## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
  Pair programming is pretty when two individuals in a coding environment who collaborate together by essentially linking brain power, they act as one driving force. A driver types/brainstorms while a navigator calls the shots/brainstorms. Its sort of like a rally car duo, the driver is given information to the given task at hand (a turn) and uses the instructions from his codriver to get to the endpoint in the most efficient way possible. 


2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
  If done correctly (both parties are actively engaged), you may/most likely will have a higher quality project, which is done by programming out loud. Both parties hold parts of understanding that the other person may not have, so it allows each other to build upon their strength and in the end each might learn something from the other. Better coordination efforts @ the job level, since you essentially halve your team to accomplish tasks. Less things going on amongst the team, a better understanding where everyone is at. The number one benefit, is the improved resilience of the driving force. Where one person might somewhere down the road of a sprint, a pair's camaraderie will improve the mental battle of struggling with code. 


3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
  Overhead costs are one drawback since again, you are essentially paying two people to do the same job but its worth it in the bigger picture as long as it doesn't cause you to take losses. (Profit is profit my goy) If the people working together don't mesh well and they don't actively program out loud, they will have a harder time solving problems and getting understanding from the task.
