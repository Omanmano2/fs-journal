## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?
  Code documentation is sort of like a service log for a semi truck. Documentation for code, specifically for functions provides key points for coworkers to have an easier understanding of the parameters that you passed and the chosen naming conventions. Looking back to our afternoon lectures, the notes left for us to have an understanding to why we might have done something somewhere with the //notation. // isnt the only documentation form, for example there are README's and code documentation

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?
  Code Documentation allows people to collaborate in a more efficient manner, since spending 20-30 minutes on slack to try and contact the person who wrote the code is sort of out of the picture, unless you message them about the documentation lol. The code is more concise and makes debugging easier since it may help spot out bad naming conventions in variables, parameters, and arguments etc.

3. How important is Code documentation and why?
  As much as documentation is overlooked by some, the importance of code documentation helps the developer themselves in case they need to come back to previous written code for reference, and just in case they forgot why they name something a certain way or if they had to do something unordinary to remember.
