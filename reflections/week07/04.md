## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
  I mostly used the pair pogramming reading this week when working with Taylor on Planit. I believed that we did really well together as partners even though it was a struggle from start to finish. We made sure we were switching frequently throughout the day, which let us get time in both driver and navigator roles. As each day went by, it came more clear as to why pair programming is effective, since there were times we found the solution after a long time of dread and usually if i was by myself I wouldve quite so much sooner.

2. What went well this week?
  Getting the partner checkpoint done was a relief, but at the same time I felt like I didn't diserve it since Mark literally had to hold my hand and walk me through all the steps. So I felt pretty dissapointed in myself because it seems that nothing is clicking and the course is still moving on. As much as I feel like im falling behind the curve, i guess I survived another week. Monday and Tuesday were pretty gnarly since I got the checkpoint barely done after getting crushed mentally. Which affected my energy levels while working with Taylor. 

3. What would you do differently?
  If i had to do something differently I wouldve tried to get more sleep because I felt like my will was pretty volatile in terms of staying cool calm and collected. The problems we were running into were irratating and more frustrating than usual.
