## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
The three ways are this:
1) function name(parameters) {
  //statements
}
This is like the vanilla of function calls. This is a very common way to define the functions parameters
2)let name = function(parameters) {
//statements 
}
This function statement uses a variable to name the function parameters which is called an anonymous function
  let name = (parameters) => {
//statements
  }
  This function is an arrorw expression expression. These do not have a THIS binding
2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
So arguments are the values we assign that the function recieves from each parameter when invoked. A parameter on the other hand are the names made in the function definition, which we can store up to 255 of for any given function.
3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
Higher ordre functions are functions that use other functions as paremters or returns another function then its considered a higher order function
