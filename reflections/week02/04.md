## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
The benefits of a making a plan before starting to write code is for a number of reason. One, is primarily to prevent yourself from coding yourself into a deep hole that you can't get out of, which was due to mispractices such as trying to write a shit ton of code in the beginning span of time when starting. This poor planning leads coders into uncharted territory which means they themselves dont exactly know whats going on under the hood of their application.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
The best way. Google. When stuck the first thing to do is some research, and research I mean putting a search engine to use. Another is if you get stuck, start question the code to see if the solution you are trying to make is really optimum for the task at hand. "do not be attached to code because of how much effort you put into it. Bad code needs to be restarted." Now im not saying i should delete my code after i fail for two hours, but rather think about taking a different approach

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
My biggest takeaways from the article were to not assume things are right even if they work, code problems cause data problems, and  not reinventing the whell.
