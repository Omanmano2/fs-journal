## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
The main ways to write information to the console is by using a console.log. We use this when seeing if our code is properly displaying data to one another. The sources tab also can be used to debug by creating breakpoints and debugging commands to stop our code at specifc points in time. Using the code editor we can also directly edit our code in real time.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
The tab that allowws you to the see breakdown of HTML/CSS is the source tab. The source tab is useful when debugging html because it allows use to make breakpoint and debuggers to view whats going on under the hood at a specific point in time. Here we may see that we have a line of code with errors laced all over

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
A good way is to ask an instructor. Jk, a better way to debug your code is i guess by using again our debugger and breakpoints to check if everything is working as we code. Or maybe a code editor would also work well since you can change stuff in real time there rather thna the console.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Today was a good learning experience on how to create functions that draw a template full of elements. Also struggling with the for loops was nice since its allowing me to get more comfortable around javascript since i find those the hardest when specifying the right data to use.
