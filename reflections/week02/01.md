## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
Scope is the range in which a variable is called. In terms of range, it refers to if the variable is called inside a block only or globally. In simpler terms, where a variable is available for use.
2. What is Hoisting ?
Hoisting is where a variable is moved to the top of the execution order (scope). For example, if a var is declared after an event, the event call wont know which data(variable) to pull from since it is at the top of the scope. Hence why we like to use let instead
3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
In most cases the let variable would be used when defining variables so we dont run into conflicts later down the road when we need to change its value in multiple blocks. Whereas a var usually should be used to store a global value that we always want to access inside a block, instead of creating that same variable multiple times over and over and over again. Const is used when wanting a global value nested only inside of a block and not on the global scope.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Todays assingment was super cool, because it felt nice getting to add more functionality to a webpage rather than just flexbox. I wanted to try my hand at a magic the gathering type of score tracker tool that would allows players to set there health and then use the desired buttons to add or subtract from their health pool. This task overall helped me understand how to create a function to change data on the screen with the use of id's and variables
