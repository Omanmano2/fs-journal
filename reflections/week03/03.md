## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?
The two common operations that we will set in the handler are 'get' and 'set'. While these are in the handler, custom logic is applied to the operation.

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?
To ensure that a value doesn't come up as undefined when using a get operand, is to know that the get operator is to return a specific key in its object. To prevent this, we use a 'trap' and log the property being modified and the valued set.

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?
One benefit of using the proxy object is so we can access certain properties of an object when it changes, such as an array. This allows us to render objects without directly hardcoding.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
When doing the gregslist app, i learned that you could use mvc to change the dom in a very efficent manner, whiler also saving things to local storage. Another topic i learned about was modal bodies and how to use them to create an object with specified data.
