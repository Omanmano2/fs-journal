## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?
Before the use of exports, it was impossible to reference another javascript file within a javascript file. This is the reason why early engineers linked multiple scripts into their index.html file. However at the large scale, this causes applications to be much less efficient which means slower computing speeds. More exact words, it affects page performance and prevents further processing. "you can concatenate all scripts in one main script by marking some of them as exports, then other modules can import them." In conclusion es6 allows imports and exports to fix this problem

2. How does export differ from export default?
export differs from export default through which it doesn't reference scripts from other domains, they must have a valid cors header. Whereas export default allows imports.


3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?
There are quite a few. Code can be divided up into smaller files (self contained). Instead of linking multiple scripts, we link one and using es6 we can import/export for efficiency. Debugging becomes easier since code is more localized to its own file. Code referencing a model understands its dependencies which means any problem that arises is more obvious. ETc etc
## Afternoon Assignment Link

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
-During todays afternoon challenge, I learned how to create a class for an object. IN this case i made different classes as in animal types, and each animal for lets say cheetah couldve its own name, height, teeth size etc. Overall the repetition has me fooling alright about the mvc pattern.
