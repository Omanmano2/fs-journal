> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
In javascript, you need to find a way to update parts of the dom to certain events that take place. In order to do this, you need a lot of push and pull requests. Using the observer pattern
it enables one to many data binding between all the elements. It also solves a common problem in client side scripting (one to many, one way, and event driven data binding)


2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
The event observe has 3 main mechanisms.
The subscribe which adds new observable events
An unsubscribe which removes observable events
Then the broadcast which executes all events with bound data


3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
The bcw template uses the observer pattern to render data generated by the user in a modal form submission into data that lies in an array to be accessed by proxy listeners which render that data onto the page. Using the 'subscribe' mechanism, a listing is printed. The unsubscribe mechanism, in this case our delete listing would serve this and by using filter functions we can dispose of unwanted data. Etc etc
