## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
  The purpose of encapsulation is so that there isnt a direct link between the view (index) and the data (appstate). This is to combat the timing dependencies and resource conflicts caused by trying to share the same memory resources between all the operations being performed. This in turns allows for a structure to help improve with debugging since most components are relays for one data structure and if theres a problem with one data structure, youll know where to look.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
  The problem with closures and the underscore prefix is that it stilll doesn't account for true privacy between data and the functions. With closures, its possible to inherit the private state with functional mixins, These mixins can allow for the manipulation of data. With underscore prefix, many people know about it from coders to hackers so this can lead to problems at the developing stage and allow hackers to exploit.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
  To create private variables in a ES6 class is to create a private fields proposal (private field). ei const myCounter = new Counter() By usaing this alias we can help ensure things stay localized to their file/method.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
  The takeaway from todays assignment was how to basically do what we learned with the zoo keeper project, but using the mvc pattern to keep data seperate from direct manipulation from the user. On top of that I had a better understanding in how to create a class object and how to specify all of its properties.
