## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?
  Time boxing is the simple act of selecting an alloted amount of time for a single task. Example, from 5-6 pm I will spend time working on my journal and from 8-9 I will spend time working on my videos for the week.
  Devote time, use it to its maximum potential and really get it done. This will help you plan time for that activity and using that planned time youll using every minute of it doing that one task, nothing else. If im workging from 5-6 im not running a load of laundry and doing dishes, I should be diving into my work and getting lost for thatt one hour.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?
  Rather than focusing on things that we want to do. We need to prioritize something that is a better use of our time and by achieving completion in our daily TO-DOs (even when we do not want to do it) the time to relax and do things like our hobby will follow. In turn I need to create schedule for saying I will be up at this time and I will go to sleep at this time and no later. From these house x-y I will do work. Then once all of my task for the day are complete I can use the allotted time I have to play games and eat junk food. Be flexible, if you didn't finish something in the time box simply set another one. Then the next day adjust your plan accordingly. If you finsh early, then again flex the plan until you have it down to a science. Know your golden hour, by knowing your hours of most productivity you can make maximum use of your time and achieve better quality work.


3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 
  During that inspire checkpoint, I spent way too much freaking time slaving away at tasks that didn't even need to be done really. Whereas I shouldve spent those same hours trying to get the TO DO list complete . If i time boxxed my tasks and gave myself time to take breaks I would've not failed imo. But rather I let my anger, pride, and ego get to me. Also I wouldve gotten a lot more work done which means I wouldve learned a hell of a lot more.
