## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?
The three types of relationships are this: Ono-To-One, One-To-Many, and Many-To-Many. The 1:1 relationship is when an author lives at a single address and an address has a single author. This describes essentially the relationshp between two entities. An example is a name property to an age property.

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`
  First lets talk about why embedding isn't the optimal choice. With embedding, consideration for storage space of 16mb isn't accounted for therefore when it comes to scaling, embedding data to a url doesnt cut it. Secondly its write performance is quite lack luster. MongoDb gets confused as the document gets larger than anticipated and will begin load the IO. Overall, embedding works for smaller applications but when sustaining an application we want to resort to linking. This is because when using embedding everytime we refresh that particular page, you have to then load every single instance of an object attached to that URL. Linking allows the original page to remain small but outsource to a different document to save space. On the downside, there is going to be a lot of read operations going on which can lead to performance lost.


3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?
  One of the challenges when facing a many to many relationship is choossing which method of embedding will take place. This is done my taking into consideration of what properties are establishing the relationship. Establish the number of N in the N:M relationship and compare it to M. If M is exponentially larger you choose one way embedding. If they are really close than you should opt for tow way embeddingg.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
  In greglist today, the repetition with building out the controllers and service without using a fakeDb was great practice with using the crud methods in turn with Postman after setting up our api database with auth0 and mongoDb.
