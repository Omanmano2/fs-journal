## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?
  The purpose of a query string is to allow the passing of information. This is between a user and a website. By appending info the the end of a url, the website can read that data and give the desired bits of information back to the user. For example, lets say I wanted the URL page to only pass me back the information that contains 'the most popular shopping item'. Then I would use a query string attached to the url to filter out my page.


2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?
  The format of a query parameter starts with a '?' folowed by the key=value parameter. An example is ?question=47 or ?pokemon=204. However, you may pass multiple query parameters such as ?a=1&b=2. The '&' seperates the parameters.


3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?
    I believe query parameters allow us to establish relationship between objects by defining parameters which we can than use to render the DOM to the desired output. For instance, if we were a clothing store selling stuff online, and the buyer wanted to filter the page to see shirts that are blue and are Vnecked. The url would have something like this '?shirt[color]=blue&[collar]=vNeck.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
  In burger shack, I learned how to use a database and use CRUD methods to either get pull post or delete data through the use of different API calls. For example, in the controller (after creating an object schema) I learned how to route the paths to manipulate what I was grabbing or what I was sending based off any responses from a user.
