## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?
  The purpose of async/await being introduced was that fact that promises still had their struggles and a gap was needed to be filled in order for that crisp async code. So overall, i guess my only real explanation is that it just makes async code a hell of a lot 'simpler'


2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?
  In order to await a promise inside a function. The function needs to be established as an async function meanining that its going to be waiting until data is properly loaded into the application.


3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?
  The primary benefits of async is that code looks again, cleaner and easier to read/comprehend. It also allows functions to return a promise which allows us to better utilize the goal for async code. Lastly, debugging is easier to do since async/await because the compiler reads it as synchronous code rather when promises will not step over asynchronous code.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
-Usually we were just using one api, but with todays assingment I somewhat learned how to use multiple apis. One api endpoint so I could bring in data for all the pokemon and then finally the sandbox api in order to push in our data for it to be saved and rendered on load and reload
