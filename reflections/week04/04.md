## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?
REST stands for : REpresentational State Transfer.
 In simpler terms a RESTful API when called, transfers data from a server and renders it to the requested resource. So if a twitter user clicks searches someobody up, the server should send the page of the person and or people that may relate to it.


2. What does Stateless mean?
  Stateless means the server doesn't remember anything about the user. It merely performs the business logic needed to perform a/the request and deliver the correct response(updating the view), REGARDLESS of other requests. Stateless helps us achieve a RESTFUL API since it allows any client/use to take action of the resources.


3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
  the request to the server needs a resource identifier. The server returns enough info so the client may modify the resource of their desire. Requests to teh API contains all the information the server needs to perform the request and vice versa. Lastly, Use of hypermedia which is how the client changes the state of the app (changing of layers in the url /enpoint/endpoint/endpoint/enpoint/)

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
-Working with Taylor me and him went through the trials and tribulations of learning how to render music of specific artists and set an active resource using its id property which we could then add to our list. I also learned not to invoke a function within a proxystate.on inside a constructor or else it defeats the whole purpsose of async code since it will try to grab the resources of the called function before the api can load the data into the app state
