> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?
  If you happen to notice code that looks like the pyramid of Giza then you are most likely looking at callback hell, or in other words something that doesnt use something like AJAX. You'll also notice the land of the logs, which is just a sea of if(err) => console.log("Owen doesn't know how to code or server is screwed"). They root cause is when writing javascript, the person tries to have code execute from top to bottom only. Again, another cause for callback hell is the lack of presence of async functions.


2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?
  Asynchronous means something that takes an allotted amount of time. Better phrased, something that will happen in the future but not as of now. This involves with callbacks because it solves the need to reload the page everytime an element is updated by the user or function, therefore callback hell is reduced significantly. The reason you want a function not to callback right away is so it can wait for the application to actually render data into the app state, because yes sending bits of info through wires/air takes time.


3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`
First, keep your code shallow. This means learn how to name functions so code is easier to read and you are able to call to functions by name rather than anonymous. Second modularize, instead of kepping everything in one spot, learn how to break up code in a location that best suits its purpose and demographic. Lastly, handle every error. TLDR console.error(error), and bam you'll know exactly when your code is shitt*ng itself

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
-Today I somewhat learned how async code works in terms of the idea of having to wait for data to be rendered in the application using an axios service. Then from their i learned how to use async functions to render that data inside the api.
