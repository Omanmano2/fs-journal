## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?
  The three states of promises are a, pending, b, resolved, and c, rejected. Pending is an initial state, before a function succeeds (grabs data and renders) or fails(can't grab data and tries to render nothing).  The resolved state is when a promise is completed (a when it goes well). Lastly if it a doesn't go well, welllllll YOU GOT REJECTED SON.


2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?
Promises seek to resolve the issues of callback hell because although we use async code, it doesn't mean that we are free from the bonds of callback hell. If we start having a ton of callback functions we'll slowling fall into callback Oblivion. By using promises we can use chaining which says if do this and then this and then this etc and if anything fails catch it and callback the failure rather making a request then a call if it failed x10 times


3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?
  Its pretty self explanatory. A .then() is for resolved promises. So essentially, hey this worked now go to your freakin job. A .catch(), is like getting denied for a job you appplied to . It's like hey, this thing failed and didn't work..... soooooo uhhhh heres your fat denial ie CONSOLE.ERROR(ERRRRRRRRORRRRRRRRR)
