## Questions

1. What is Component based architecture?
  Component Based Architecture (CBA) is a method to encapsulate individual building blocks of the User Interface. The Builing blocks are called Components. Components are the fundamental idea are CBA and its to achieve a page that can render individual pieces of the DOM instead of reloading the entire HTML. An example, of a component is a the friends list on Facebook, the Feed, the News, etc. These components are individually rendered, meaning they all have independence and become anti social. They have their own structure, methods, and APIs. Guess what, they can be copied and pasted.

2. What are some benefits of Component based architecture?
  One benefit is that they make coding an UI much faster due to the way of architecture, and allow the abstraction of data in terms of pagination. Ex I can reuse the same HTML template for the dom and all I have to do is change a call to another components inside the html to render the page differently. Plus, this means that you do not need to refresh the page yet again when making changes to the HTML. In terms of React.js, the use of a virtual DOM, similar to the Shadow DOM for Vue, use a "diffing" algorith to render changes seperately from other components.

3. What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?
  It leads to bloated and polluted views. In a way it goes against some of the principles of the MVC pattern since CBA encapsulates a lot of responsibility in one area. CBA's also tend to be like a BMW, over engineered and complex. Further depth on over engineering, it shouldn't be used to render every single aspect of the UI. Not everything must be a component.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
  While messing around in the Vue Playground, I got to get settle in with using Vue.js rather than just vanilla js. My mind is quite blown on how intuitive the Vue framework makes creating a UI. In the exercises, I learned some main concepts like Expression, Bindings, Looping, Computed Properties, Conditional Rendering, and Events. Getting to mess around with it was pretty fun, but it seemed like I struggled more than everybody else.
