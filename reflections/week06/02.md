## Questions

1. What are props?
  Similar to what we do in javascript when passing arguments using variables, in Vue we use props to pass values to that component and alter them to our desire. There are two main characteristics to props. Props are passed down the component tree, meaning that props cant be passed from child to parent nor can they be modified by the child.
  In the end, we use props to alter the html in our template 

2. What are props used for?
  By utilizing props, we can set them to values such as: strings, numbers boolean, arrays, and objects. We can then set expectations for what the template will recieve and portray that on our page. example with the camera prop, with one prop we were able to create a h tag a span tag and a img tag all calling to the same prop


3. Where can props be used or accessed?
  Props can be used and accessed in watchers, lifecycle hooks, methods, and computed props

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
  Using the APOD api to take an image based off its date and draw it using vue was so much more difficult than I thought, and thats mainly due to the fact that Im still trying to learn the landscape. However working out my problems with an instructor rather than bash my head in was very helpful and let me learn how to use the script part of the vue template to bring in different functions from the service layer and use it to create a small app.
